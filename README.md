# Personal Website
Built primarily in Javascript to simulate a terminal window that accepts commands and displays information about me.

## List of Commands
```h``` or ```help``` : display all available commands

```ls``` : a list of all available pages that you could 'navigate' to

```clear``` : clear the terminal window

'up' and 'down' arrow key : previous commands you have entered
